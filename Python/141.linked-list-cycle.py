#
# Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
#
# To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which
# represents the position (0-indexed)Â in the linked list where tail connects
# to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.
#
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
# Output: true
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
# second node.
#
#
#
#
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
# Output: true
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
# first node.
#
#
#
#
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: head = [1], pos = -1
# Output: false
# Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
# Follow up:
#
# Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?
